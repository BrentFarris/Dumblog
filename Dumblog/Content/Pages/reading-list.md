# Reading List
I am not usually one to have a reading list, I never really read many books. I think I have a psychogenic belief that I am dyslexic because I have a hard time reading long texts. I even use a screen reader to read most things. However when it comes to code and books I'm really interested in (physics, math, or code) I seem to be able to read those books just fine. So, in light of this fact, I have a new reading list! Here it is in no particular order:
