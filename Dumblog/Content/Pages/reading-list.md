# Reading List
Brent Farris
___

I am not usually one to have a reading list, I never really read many books. I think I have a psychogenic belief that I am dyslexic because I have a hard time reading long texts. I even use a screen reader to read most things. However when it comes to code and books I'm really interested in (physics, math, or code) I seem to be able to read those books just fine. So, in light of this fact, I have a new reading list! Here it is in no particular order:

### Clean Code: [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/2LLvJo7)

Robert Martin (aka Uncle Bob Martin) has been evangelizing clean code for quite some time through many talks, his website ["Clean Coders"](https://cleancoders.com/), and through [his book](https://amzn.to/2LLvJo7) seen to the left here. With his very in depth history in computer science he has a lot of weight behind his words. Most of his examples are explained using Java (he is very openly biased against C# and .NET in general), but the principals that he goes over are all language agnostic. The primary learnings to take from his talks are TDD (Test Driven Development) is king of all code and keeping your code as simple and readable as possible, to the point that comments are not even needed.
